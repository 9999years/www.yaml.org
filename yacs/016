--- YAML:1.0
location: http://www.yaml.org/yacs/016
abstract: Assumed Header
owner: ingy
status: !yac/status
 state: new
 date: 2002-01-02
 reason: 
proposal: \
 If a YAML stream does not begin with a header line then a header line
 of "--- YAML:1.0\n" is assumed.
 
rationale: \
 This would eliminate the special case of a headerless stream. One could
 concatenate new documents onto it, by using the canonical header.

 I assume this would also clean up the productions considerably.

examples:
 - |
  this: is document #1
  ---
  this: is document #2
