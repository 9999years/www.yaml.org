    <p>YAML<sup><small>(tm)</small></sup> is an international
       collaboration to make a data serialization language which
       is both human readable and computationally powerful.
       The founding members of YAML are
      <a href="mailto:ingy@ttul.org">Brian Ingerson</a> (author of the Perl
         module <a 
         href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/INGY/Data-Denter-0.12/Denter.pod">
         Data::Denter</a>), 
      <a href="mailto:cce@clarkevans.com"> Clark Evans</a>, and
      <a href="mailto:oren@ben-kiki.org">Oren Ben-Kiki</a>.
       YAML emerged from the union of two efforts.  The
       first was Brian Ingerson's need for a serialization
       format for <a href="http://inline.perl.org">Inline</a>,
       this resulted in his Data::Denter module.
       The second, was the joint work of Oren Ben-Kiki
       Clark Evans on simplifying XML within the <a 
       href="http://www.docuverse.com/smldev/" >sml-dev</a> group.
       YAML was first publicized with a &lt;?xmlhack?&gt; <a  
       href="http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1213">article</a>
       on 12 May 2001.  Oren and Clark's vision for YAML
       was very similar to Brian's Data::Denter, and vice versa,
       thus a few days later they teamed up and YAML was born.</p>
   <p>Since the initial founding, many additional people have come
      on board and have made YAML a serious contender for your 
      data serialization needs.  This includes Neil Watkiss, who
      is working on libyaml, Rolf Veen who is working on a Java
      implementation, Steve Howell who is working with Brian on
      applications for YAML, Brian Quinlin, and Andrew Kurn who
      is keeping us honest.</p>
