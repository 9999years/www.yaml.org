abstract: Nextline Scalar Indicators

proposal: \
 The nextline scalar indicators should be comprised of a group of
 sigils that each have a specific meaning. The needs we have today are
 folded, block, escaped, chomped and indentation. I propose '^' for
 folded (based on shape of the sigil), '|' for block, '\' for escaped,
 '-' for chomped, and #<digit> for indentation. Possibly '+' for
 'unchomped' (add a trailing newline).
 
 A combination always begins with either '^' or '|' which are
 mutually exclusive. The order of sigils after that is '\', '-' or
 '+', and finally #<digit> Please note: I am not particularly tied 
 to the choice of sigils.

rationale: \
 We currently support '\', '\\', '|' and '||'. But '|\' and '||\' should
 also be allowed.

 This proposal collapses our nextline forms into one group with several
 properties. We can then add properties in the future without having to
 change everything.

 The default indentation should be '#1'. Autodetecting indentation is
 problematic. The other default option is to scan the entire scalar for
 the minimum indentation. This is somewhat elegant, but Oren will
 probably balk on the lookahead. Either way is fine by me.

examples:
 - |
  one: ^
   Folded unescaped scalar without trailing 
   newline. Indentation defaults to 1.
  two: | 
   This is a block with:
       - Trailing newline
       - Indentation level of 1
  three: \#3
        The indentation level here is three
     spaces. Often people will start a paragraph
     with spaces, which is why using the first 
     line for default indentation is bad.
  four: |\-#2
    This block has:
      - No trailing newline.
      - Indented by 2 spaces.
      - Might con\tain escapes
  five: ^+
   This folded scalar actually ends with a
   newline character.
  six: ^\
   Folded and\nescaped.
  seven: ^\+#5
       The full monty.\nFolded, escaped, trailing
       newline, indented at 5 spaces.
