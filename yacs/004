--- YAML:1.0
location: http://www.yaml.org/yacs/004
abstract: URIs for TTLs 
owner: cce
status: !yac/status
 state: rejected
 date: 2002-01-01
 reason: \
  YAC 005 was decided to be the better choice as it is does not require
  a leading ':'.
proposal: \
 Use a URI mechanism for TLLs.
rationale: \
 Avoid the potential name collisions between a language and a domain.
 Create a top-level URI scheme for use by YAML types. Names in this
 scheme would look like DNS reverse strings, but the top level would be
 a language name and anything further would be language-specific
 package names.

  The interpretation of transfer methods would be as follows:

  Transfer Method     Namespace         Type
  !type	              org.yaml          type
  !tld.domain|type    tld.domain        type
  !:lang|type         yaml:lang         type
  !:lang.package|type yaml:lang.package type
  !scheme:path|type   scheme:path       type
