--- YAML:1.0
location: http://www.yaml.org/yacs/012
abstract: Throwaways
owner: ingy
status: !yac/status
 state: new
 date: 2002-01-02
 reason: ~
proposal: \
 Thowaways, which include blank lines and '#' style comments, should be
 allowed anywhere (at any indentation level) that they are not ambiguous
 with multi-line content.

rationale: \
 People like to add blank lines to separate out content visually. They
 also like to be able to comment out any part of a document by just
 adding a leading '#'. YAML currently has too many restrictions
 regarding throwaways.

examples:
 - |

       # Comments and blank line can precede the header
  
  ---
      # Comments can be at any indentation.
  one: a blank line follows

  two: \
   This is a multiline
#  This line has been commented out
   # This line is content because of the indentation level
       # so is this one

  # This is a comment but the line above and below are content
  
  three: the end
