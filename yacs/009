abstract: Series of Maps Collapse #2
owner: oren
status: !yac/status
 state: rejected
 date: 2002-01-01
 reason: reason for rejection
proposal: \
 Restrict special in-series in-line keyed syntax. Solve the problem by
 requiring both the key and value to be in-line and restrict this style
 to a single key:value pair.
rationale: \
 Current syntax is problematic.
examples:

  - key: value
  - key: value
