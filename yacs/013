proposal: \
 Indentation can be from 1-9 spaces wide per level. Indentation only
 needs to be consistent for a given scope level. In other words a
 different indentation width may be chosen for each new scope level.
 
 In the general case, indentation for a new level is determined
 implicitly by the first line on that level. Every other line at that
 scope level must use the same indentation width.

 The exception to this rule is the indentation for the nextline scalar
 format. This indentation is always assumed to be a single space unless
 an explicit indicator is used. (See YAC-014)
 
rationale: \
 We have found one space indentation to be the most optimal for general
 cases. If we were forced to chose a rigid format we all agree single
 space would be best. It was a good idea for us to choose a rigid
 indentation early on, so that we could develop the language in a more
 controlled environment.

 Now that the issues are close to being finalized, it appears that we
 can add in flexible indentation without harming much. We've also seen
 usage cases where single space doesn't provide the optimal visual
 separation.

 Lastly, flexible indentation helps resolve the quandries encountered in
 YAC-010 (aka 6.2).

examples:
 - |
   foo: two
   too:
      fee: three
   boo: who
   block: |
    default
    is
    single
   folded: \#3
         Sometimes people like to put a few spaces at
      the beginning of a paragraph, so using the first line
      for indentation is problematic.
