        <li><b>Is there an official extension for YAML files?</b><br/></br/>
            <p>Please use ".yaml" when possible.</p>
        <li><b>Why does YAML forbid tabs?</b><br/></br/>
            <p>
Tabs have been outlawed since they are treated differently
by different editors and tools.  And since indentation is so
critical to proper interpretation of YAML, this issue is just
too tricky to even attempt.   Indeed Guido van Rossum of Python
has acknowledged that allowing TABs in Python source is a
headache for many people and that were he to design Python
again, he would forbid them.</p>
