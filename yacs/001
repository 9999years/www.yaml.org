owner: oren
status: !yac/status
 state: rejected
 date: 2002-01-01
 reason: \
  Rejected due to aesthetics. The additional complication in
  specification was considered acceptable.

 Change the separator between type and format to '~' from ';'. 
rationale: \
 Avoid the use of characters valid in a URI to allow for a uniform
 character set in all three parts of a transfer method.
