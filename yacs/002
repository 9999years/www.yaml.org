--- YAML:1.0
location: http://www.yaml.org/yacs/002
abstract: URI character decoding.
owner: cce
status: !yac/status
 state: rejected
 date: 2002-01-01
 reason: \
  Can't be done in a scheme independent way without changing URI
  semantics. YAML namespace URIs would have to be written in
  canonical format.
proposal: \
 Have the parser do '%' URI character decoding.
rationale: \
 Allow writing URIs in standard format.
