abstract: Simple Leaves

status: !yac/status
 state: accepted

proposal: \
 Rename implicit leafs to simple leaves. Not every implicit leaf is
 necessarily implicitly typed (it may be explicitly typed). Also other
 leaf styles may be implicitly typed (using a '!' transfer method). A
 simple rename solves the problem.
rationale: \
 Two names for two concepts.
