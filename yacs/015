--- YAML:1.0

abstract: Top Level Inline Scalars

 reason: ~
proposal: \
 Inline scalars should be allowed as top level nodes. In other words,
 they should be able to be put on YAML header lines.

 The only potential conflict is simple scalars. We can avoid this
 conflict by simply requiring the '!' property after any directives
 on a header.

rationale: \
 There are two rather weak reasons why we don't allow them. The first is
 potential conflict with directives. This can only happen with simple
 scalars, since directives can't begin with quotes.
 
 The second reason is that I originally thought they were aesthetically
 displeasing.

 Sarathy asked me if YAML was flexible enough to serialize any structure
 on a single line. As I thought about this, I realized the only reason
 this wasn't possible is because we don't allow top level inlines.

 If we allow top level inlines, then we can use inline collections on
 headers as well.
 
 I think it might actually improve the productions by taking away this
 somewhat arbitrary restriction.

 This also allows us to use [] and {} instead of !seq and !map.
