proposal: \
 Drop the special sigil based Perl object names in favor of a more
 explicit and scalable system.

rationale: \
 Currently Perl transfer types use '!perl/@Foo' for array objects,
 '!perl/Bar' for hash objects and '!perl/glob' for non-object globs. But
 what if I want to bless a glob?

 The sigil system is too special. I'd rather have mandatory type name,
 followed by optional blessed class name. This covers everything nicely.

examples:
 - |
  # Perl specific transfers can be aliases for some yaml ones
  this1: !perl/hash
  is the same as 1: !map
  this2: !perl/array
  is the same as 2: !seq
  this3: !perl/ref
  is the same as 3: !ptr
  # The generic Perl types
  glob: !perl/glob
  regex: !perl/regex
  scalar: !perl/scalar
  # Any of the above (except ref) can be blessed
  blessed hash: !perl/hash:Foo::Bar
  blessed glob: !perl/glob:Glob::Object
  blessed scalar: !perl/scalar:ScalarObject
