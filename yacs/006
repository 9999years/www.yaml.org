abstract: Unrecognized explicitly typed simple leaves
owner: cce
status: !yac/status
 state: accepted
 date: 2002-01-01
proposal: \
 Allow unrecognized explicitly typed implicit (simple) leafs. Change
 the wording to make it clear an implicit (simple) leaf may be in a
 format which isn't one of the recognized implicit formats, but instead
 in one of the explicit formats for the explicit type family it is
 annotated with.
rationale: \
 This was the intention all along.
