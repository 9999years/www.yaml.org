abstract: Top Level Language
owner: cce
status: !yac/status
 state: accepted
 date: 2002-01-01
proposal: \
 Introduce the concept of a TLL (Top Level Language).
rationale: \
 Allow a separate namespace for each computer language. Add top level
 language names at the same level as top level domains, for example
 !java.package|Type and !c#.package|Type. The problem is that this
 raises potential colission problems between language names and top
 level domain names.
examples: 
 - |
  - !java.package|Type
  - !c#.package|Type
