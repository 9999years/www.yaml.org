abstract: Uniform URI Mechanism
owner: cce
status: !yac/status
 state: accepted
 date: 2002-01-01
proposal: \
 Use a uniform URI mechanism.
rationale: \
 Use a single mechanism for all namespaces. Create a top-level URI
 scheme yaml:. Make it a generic hierarchical URI for any language
 specific or generic data type. Use this URI scheme whenever there's no
 specific scheme specified. The authority is the language name or 'any'
 for generic types. The hiererchy is defined by the language.

  The interpretation of transfer methods would be as follows:

  Transfer Method       Namespace             Type
  !type	                yaml://any/org/yaml   type
  !/tld/domain|type     yaml://any/tld/domain type
  !lang|type            yaml://lang           type
  !lang/package|type    yaml://lang/package   type
  !//lang/package|type  yaml://lang/package   type
  !scheme:whatever|type scheme:whatever	      type
